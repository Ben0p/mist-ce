            <p><strong>At Mist.io, we base our business on trust and reliability.</strong> But when it comes to your servers' health and uptime, there is a problem with startups. Short life-expectancy. Most startups will either stagnate and die, or succeed and get acquired by someone bigger.</p>
            <p><strong>In the past, there have been a series of acquisitions</strong> in the cloud management market: Google bought StackDriver, Tapp was acquired by Flexiant, Citrix bought ScaleXtreme, Rackspace bought CloudKick and many more.</p>
            <p><strong>We have suffered by services we got to rely upon being shut down</strong> and we don't want to be one of them. So we always make sure that even if at some point we have to shut down a product, we will have your back covered. Thats why we pledge the following:</p>
            <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;If we shut down a product</strong>, you will be able to export your data in a non-proprietary format that can be accessed by open-source software.</p>
            <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;Most of our code is already open-source</strong> and we will release the rest and help you setup your own instance.</p>
            <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;We already have a powerful API,</strong> but we will build export scripts to help you get your data as easily as possible.</p>
            <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;You will have plenty of time to set up your own instances.</strong> We will keep our services running for as long as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>We love Mist.io</strong> and we would like to be able to promise you that we'll keep it running forever. But eternity is a long time and we're not in the business of making promises we can't keep. What we can do, is assure you that we want to build a product that will outlast our company and that we will never turn our back on our users. Trust, can only be built upon mutual respect.</p>

                <li> <strong>Permission to Use the Service.</strong> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Mist.io grants to you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, freely revocable right and license to access and use the Service and the content made available via the Service. Certain downloadable Mist.io software made available on or through the Service or via third parties may be provided to you under separate licensing terms. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself (such as your name, location, e-mail address or other contact information). You agree that the information you provide to us is and will be accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:support@mist.io" class="ui-link">support@mist.io</a>. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Payment.</strong> Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may require you to pay fees, including a periodic subscription fee. Additionally, our third party payment services providers may charge additional fees for the use of their services, including fees in connection with cross-border monetary transactions. Before you are required to pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the applicable fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Mist.io or its third party payment service providers may change any fees, including by adding fees, on a going-forward basis at any time. Mist.io or its third party payment service providers will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase (the "Payment Method"), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use. You authorize Mist.io to charge all sums described in these Terms to that Payment Method. If you pay any applicable fees with a credit card, Mist.io may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Subscription; Automatic Renewal.</strong> Your "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). <br> <br> </li>

                <li> <strong>Disclaimers; No Warranties</strong> <br> THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND ON AN 'AS AVAILABLE' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE MIST.IO ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (i) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (ii) ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE MIST.IO ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. <br> <br> NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE MIST.IO ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ALL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICE, YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER SERVICE USERS, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE SERVICE AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF SUCH MATERIALS OR CONTENT. <br> SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. <br> <br> </li>

THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Governing Law. </strong>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Mist.io agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all disputes. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration </strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li> <strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Mist.io in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Mist.io agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MIST.IO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. </li>
                        <li> <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Notwithstanding subsection 19.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. <br> </li>
                        <li> <strong>Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and Mist.io will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, 'AAA Rules') of the American Arbitration Association ('AAA'), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Mist.io. <br> </li>
                        <li> <strong>Notice; Process.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ('Notice'). Mist.io's address for Notice is: Mist.io, Inc., c/o Todd Carpenter, Esq., Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, 139 Townsend Street, Suite 150, San Francisco, CA 94107. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ('Demand'). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Mist.io may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Mist.io shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Mist.io shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Mist.io in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater. <br> </li>
                        <li> <strong>Fees.</strong> In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Mist.io will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Mist.io for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. <br> </li>
                        <li> <strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND MIST.IO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Mist.io agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. <br> </li>
                        <li> <strong>Modifications.</strong> In the event that Mist.io makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Mist.io's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Mist.io's address for Notice, in which case your account with Mist.io shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive. </li>
                        <li> <strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Subsection 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. <br> <br> </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Consent to Electronic Communications.</strong> By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Mist.io regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. <br> <br> </li>
                <li> <strong>Contact Information.</strong> The services hereunder are offered by Mist.io Inc., located at 620 Folsom St #100 San Francisco, CA 94107. You may contact us by sending correspondence to the foregoing address or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@mist.io">support@mist.io</a>.
