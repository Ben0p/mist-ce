		"description": "<p>The cloud orchestration service is based on Cloudify, the open-source, TOSCA-based orchestration platform. The service is similar to AWS’ OpsWorks but is designed for heterogeneous infrastructure. This means you can create a single, reusable template to provision the same application across different cloud providers, data centers, or colo environments.</p><p>Combine Cloud Orchestration with other Mist.io features such as monitoring, scheduling, RBAC, and/or APIs, to create automated and dynamic workflows and policies that respond to system events in real time.</p>",
