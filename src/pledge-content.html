        <p><strong>At Mist.io, we base our business on trust and reliability.</strong> But when it comes to your servers’ health and uptime, there is a problem with startups. Short life-expectancy. Most startups will either stagnate and die, or succeed and get acquired by someone bigger.</p>
        <p><strong>In the past, there have been a series of acquisitions</strong> in the cloud management market: Google bought StackDriver, Tapp was acquired by Flexiant, Citrix bought ScaleXtreme, Rackspace bought CloudKick and many more.</p>
        <p><strong>We have suffered by services we got to rely upon being shut down</strong> and we don’t want to be one of them. So we always make sure that even if at some point we have to shut down a product, we will have your back covered. Thats why we pledge the following:</p>
        <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;If we shut down a product</strong>, you will be able to export your data in a non-proprietary format that can be accessed by open-source software.</p>
        <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;Most of our code is already open-source</strong> and we will release the rest and help you setup your own instance.</p>
        <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;We already have a powerful API,</strong> but we will build export scripts to help you get your data as easily as possible.</p>
        <p class="indent-40"><strong>&raquo; &nbsp;You will have plenty of time to set up your own instances.</strong> We will keep our services running for as long as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>We love Mist.io</strong> and we would like to be able to promise you that we’ll keep it running forever. But eternity is a long time and we’re not in the business of making promises we can’t keep. What we can do, is assure you that we want to build a product that will outlast our company and that we will never turn our back on our users. Trust, can only be built upon mutual respect.</p>
        <p class="right right-align">Sincerely,<br>The Mist.io team</p>
