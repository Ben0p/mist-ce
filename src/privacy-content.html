        <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Mist.io, Inc. (“Mist.io”, “we,” or “us”) and our Web site at <a href="https://mist.io" class="ui-link">https://mist.io</a> (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies to this Site and all related web sites and mobile applications (including tablet applications) owned and operated by Mist.io. Mist.io values the privacy of all individuals who visit and use the Site (individually, “User” and collectively, “Users”) and makes it a priority to protect any personally identifiable information that it obtains from its Users. This Privacy Policy describes Mist.io’s policies regarding what personally identifiable information Mist.io gathers from its Users, how Mist.io uses that information, and what Mist.io does to protect that information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference in the Mist.io Terms of Use, and capitalized terms not defined herein are defined in the Mist.io Terms of Use. [hyperlink to Terms of Use]</p>
        <p>By using the Site (whether or not you register for an account for the Site), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy. If you do not want the personally identifiable information provided to Mist.io to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or any services provided through it.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Information Mist.io Collects:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>User-provided Information: When you register for an account for the Service or at any later time, you may provide to Mist.io what is generally known as “personally identifiable information” (such as your name, password, email address, postal mailing address, and telephone number). From time to time, Mist.io may also ask you to provide other information if you so choose and if Mist.io deems it necessary or helpful in the provision of Mist.io Services or any part thereof. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Mist.io the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Please note that any credit card or other information related to your Payment Method is provided directly by you to a third party payment services provider; Mist.io does not collect or store that information and this Privacy Policy does not apply to that information. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“Cookies” Information: When you visit the Site, whether or not you register for an account, Mist.io may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. Mist.io may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain services or features available on Service.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“Automatically Collected” Information: When you access or use the Site or any other part of Service, Mist.io’s servers may automatically record certain information from your browser by using different types of technology, including standard log files, “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” These “server logs” may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data, operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Site. Additionally, Mist.io may record certain information regarding your use of the Service, such as information regarding the services or features you have used, the number of servers you connect to the Service, and certain statistics related to your usage of the Service. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Third Party Web Beacons: Mist.io may also implement third party content, such as textual or graphical links, on the Site that uses “clear gifs,” “web beacons,” or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser, or implement similar tracking mechanisms, in connection with your viewing of that third party content displayed on the Site or otherwise made available through Service. This information is collected directly by such third party, and Mist.io does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies and Mist.io is not responsible for, reviews or controls those policies. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Third party analytics services: Mist.io may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, which may collect certain types of information in connection with your use of the Service. However, these third party analytics services do not provide Mist.io with any personally identifiable information about you. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Your communications: When you send email or other communications to Mist.io, Mist.io may retain that email or other communications and collect information associated with that email or other communications such as the content, date and time of these messages.

            <li>
                <p>In the event that Mist.io is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, it reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that it has collected from its Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. </p>
